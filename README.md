By calling move down twice, the object does goes from its initial spot to 2 pixels lower, and three times repeats the step and puts the object 3 pixels lower instead of 2.
By calling make invisible twice, it opens a blue j picture demo.
When writing the color without the quotes it shows up as an error.
I added a screenshot of the objects after making the changes.
I also added a screenshot of the house which is the final task of this section of the lab.
